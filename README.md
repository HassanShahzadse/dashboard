## Prerequisites

Before setting up the React Frontend Dashboard, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- Backend server with login, signup, and role-based authentication endpoints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HassanShahzadse/dashboard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd react-frontend-dashboard
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Open the `.env` file located in the project root directory.

2. Configure the backend API endpoint URLs:

   ```
   REACT_APP_LOGIN_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/login
   REACT_APP_SIGNUP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/signup
   REACT_APP_PROFILE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/profile
   ```

   Replace the URLs with the appropriate backend API endpoints for login, signup, and profile management.

3. Save the changes to the `.env` file.

## Usage

1. Start the React development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React Frontend Dashboard.

   The initial page will display a login/signup form.

3. Use the provided form to sign up for a new account or log in with existing credentials.

4. After successful authentication, the dashboard will be displayed with the user's profile information.

5. The user can edit their own profile, while the admin has the ability to edit or delete any user's profile.

6. Protected routing is implemented, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the dashboard and profile editing functionality.
